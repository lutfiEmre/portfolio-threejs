          Hi, I'm Emre Lutfi-a front-end developer with a passion for user experience. While writing scalable interfaces with Next.js, React, TypeScript and TailwindCSS, I aim to deliver fluid and memorable experiences to visitors by bringing interaction to 3D scenes with tools like Framer Motion and Three.js. I care about type safety and code readability, and equally value performance, design integrity, and accessibility. Working on real-world problems while studying Software Engineering nourishes me; I see every bug report as an opportunity to learn, and I retain the knowledge gained through detailed documentation.
